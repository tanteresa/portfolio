							<h1>U.S. Small Business Administration</h1>

							<p>The SBA is a federal agency that supports America's small businesses and entrepreneurs. For the last 2 years, my team has been fully redesigning the agency's main site to better serve small business owners. The website gets roughly 19+ million unique visitors a year.</p>
							<p><strong>My role: </strong>I am the lead designer on this project. I do end-to-end product design and established the design process precedents within our team. I also created our design system and style guide from scratch.

										<h2>Our challenge</h2>
										
											
										</header>
										<div class="content onload-image-content-in">
											<p>SBA.gov in the past was a typical government website: extremely content heavy, disorganized, cluttered, and difficult to navigate. Content for different audiences were clumped together in the same section, sometimes even within the same page. Many of the articles are written from the perspective of a government worker with a lot of internal jargon not used by a typical business owner. The website was very unapproachable to the average small business owner, yet our audience frequently look to the SBA for help and as a source of authority over the matters of starting a business.</p>

											<p>You can check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331071455/https://www.sba.gov/" target="_blank">old site</a> if you're curious.</p>

										<h2>Project goals</h2>
												
											
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>We aimed to completely streamline and modernize the website in the first MVP release. The website would be made for small business owners first and foremost, not for internal government employees. We plan on turning SBA.gov into a platform for business owners to start and manage their business by building in a number of apps to help with various business needs.</p>

										<h2>User research</h2>	
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<h3>Method</h3>
											<p>We interviewed a number of people to figure out how SBA.gov could best serve small business owners with the agencyâ€™s goals in mind. We spoke to executive leadership of various SBA departments, business counselors partnered through the SBA, and small business owners themselves. We also examined Google Analytics data and Foresee survey results for the site.</p>
											<h3>Findings</h3>
											<p>Starting a business can be very overwhelming for users. We found that communicating content in clearly defined steps resonated with users. They can more easily identify where they are in their journey and it helps make the process seem less daunting. (Trello board of our synthesized user interview notes below)</p>

										<div class="content">
											
											<p>I created a sketch symbol library and design system (using Invision Design System Manager) of all our existing web components. This allows the other designers on our team to quickly create designs using the components I have standardized and keeping the look and feel of our products consistent. The developers use my style guide to make sure the front-end is pixel perfect.</p>
